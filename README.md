(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?

The videos provided were very helpful in walking me through the assignment step by step. I also enjoyed the questions related to the code syntax in the assignment. They encouraged me to explore and teach myself, making the learning process more engaging and practical. It's far more effective to learn by doing than by just studying theory.

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
